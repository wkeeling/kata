The Russians are coming they cry. Terrorism! Terrorism! Give us the money! Each year as the budget looms, the defence lobby screams blue murder to make its case for more cash. The army worries about losing soldiers. The navy and Royal Air Force worry about the merger of the paratroop and marine brigade and the loss of more frigates.

The truth is that in proportion to the size of its population, Britain's defence budget is one of the largest in the world. It is the largest in the EU, and the second largest in Nato. This is unrrelated to threat, and entirely related to history. At each defence spending review, the question asked is not what the country needs, but what it can do without.

The army has only itself to blame. When labour came to power in 1997, and then the coalition government in 2010, they had the chance to re-visit the policy on Britain's aircraft carriers and Trident. Both cost huge amounts but serve little defence purpose, particularly in the modern age of unmanned warfare. The Navy and the RAF lobbied furiously, but the army kept quiet. Inevitably Downing Street capitulated and the navy and RAF got what they wanted, largely at the army's expense.

Last year Britain launched its second aircraft carrier at a cost of close to Â£7 billion and the Trident programme was extended. The lunacy of Trident was further illustrated by the removal of it from the defence budget. It now sits alongside HS2 and ... under the heading "vanity project".

It is high time Britain's three defence services are be merged into one. This would allow spending to be viewed objectively in the round, rather than through the lens of objective lobbying. Defence should be viewed from the threat upwards, not from history down.
