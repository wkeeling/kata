Every year as the budget looms, the defence lobby waves shrouds and howls blue murder to make its case for more cash. The army fears it will lose thousands of soldiers. The navy and Royal Air Force fear the merger of the paratroop and marine brigades and the loss of more frigates.

Britain's defence budget in proportion to the size of its population is one of the largest in the world, the largest in the EU and second largest in Nato. This is unrrelated to threat and entirely related to history. Each year the question asked is not what the nation needs, but how much less it can make do with.
