Drive a truck down a New York street and knock people down and you're a "sick and derranged person". But what if you drive a truck down a New York street and knock people down whilst shouting "Alluha Akbar"? You're a Muslim terrorist, a national security threat, a global news headline. You drive a president to "extreme vetting" procedures and bring down a plaugue on all Muslims who dare enter the United States.

When President Trump first tweeted about this week's attack in New York, he sensibly assumed the  "derranged person" thesis. Whilst keen to exaggerate bad news in foreign cities,  as in recent London terror attacks, he is more restrained when it affects his home town. Only when told about the "Alluha Akbar" chant did he change his stance. Then he had to be the man of power, the defender of the nation.

It seems that the offender is yet another "lone wolf". He had the familiar background of "rootless" immigrant, described by those who knew him as quiet, hard-working, an Uber driver who passed the security checks and who had a wife and family. He entered America in 2010 from Uzbekistan, a country not on the "dangerously" Muslim places list of Trump's. Trump
