Drive a truck down a New York street and run people down and you're a "sick and derranged persion". But what if you drive a truck down a New York street, run people down and shout "Alluha Akbar"? You're a Muslim terrorist, a threat to national security and a global news headline. You drive a president to introduce "extreme vetting" procedures and bring down a plaugue on all Muslims who dare enter the United States.

When President Trump first rushed to tweek about Tuesday's New York killings he sensibly assumed the "derranged person"  theis. Whilst the president is keen to amplify such news taking place in a foreign city, he is reluctant to do so when the news is about his home town. Only when told about the "Allahu Akbar" chant did he change his stance. Then he had to be the man of power, defender of his nation.
