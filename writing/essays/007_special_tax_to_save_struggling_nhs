A special NHS tax is bad idea. The concept put forward today by a group of health professionals is naive. Firstly it won't happen, and is thus just a distraction in getting more money for health. Secondly, if it were to happen, every other good cause would start demanding its own tax: housing, schools, student fees and the army. The Treasury would simply use it as an excuse to slash existing spending on them.

That 10 senior figures from the NHS, general practice and nursing on a panel set up by the Lib Dems would want more for their service is not surprising.

This winter's flu epidemmic has placed a huge amount of pressure on hospitals. As usual, crritical operations have had to be postponed for lack of beds. People have been moved in and moved out of hospital. But this is no indicator of a lack of money. It is more a breakdown in coordination between GPs, hospitals and community care.
