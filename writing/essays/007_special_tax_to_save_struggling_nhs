A special tax for the NHS is a bad idea. The concept as put forward recently by a group of health professionals is naive. First, it won't happen and is thus a distraction from getting more money for health. Second, if it were to go ahead, then every other good cause would demand its own tax: housing, schools, student fees and the army. It would give the Treasury an excuse to slash existing spending on them.

That a panel of ten senior figures from across the NHS, general practice and nursing as set up by the Lib Dems would want more money for their service is not suprising.

This winter has seen the worst flu epidemic in a decade put intense pressure on hospitals. Critical operations have been postponed due to a lack of beds as people are moved in and out of hospital. This does not prove a lack of money, but reflects a breadown in coordination between GPs, hospitals and local council community care.

Tony Blair and then Gordon Brown poured massive resources into the NHS. The chief beneficeries were medical salaries, drug company profits and PFI contractors. After 2010, the coalition austerity cuts slashed community care by as much as a third, innudating sugeries and clogging.
