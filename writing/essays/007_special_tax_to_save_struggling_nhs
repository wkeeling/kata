A special tax for the NHS is a bad idea. The concept as put forward today by a group of health professionals is naive. First of all it won't happen and thus becomes a distraction from properly financing the health service. Second, if it were to go ahead then every other good cause would want its own tax - from housing, schools. student fees and the army. The Treasury would simply use it as an excuse to slash existing spending on them.
