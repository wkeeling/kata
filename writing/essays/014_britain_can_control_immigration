In politics, optics trump metrics. Tuesday's leak of a Home Office draft on post-EU migration policy reflects the ugliest face of Brexit. The language of the report is repressive. It reads like a prison govenor's report, concerned less with the welfare of inmates and more with the height of the perimeter fence. What with the border computer mess, embarassment over immigrant detention violence and the bizarre "go home" letters sent to foreigners, if the Home Office were a local council it would be in special measures. However the message is spun, the idea that Theresa May seeks an emoillient approach to Brexit is laughable.

The document is economically illiterate. This is presumaby because Amber Rudd's migration advisory committe, producing a report on Brexit's costs. is not published until next year. The proposed bureaucracy, permeating into the records of all employers and landlords will be colossal. It is reminiscent of the chaos triggered by state income controls of the 1970s. It would need an inspector in every building.

The labour costs that the policy would demand on some of Britain's larget industries across leisure and tourism, health and welfare and the construction industry are incalculable. Stifling foreign access to labour markets is old fashioned syndicalism. It mocks the leavers' claim that blocking borders will somehow elevate Britain's role in expanding the global economy.

To be generous, departments  are allowed to provide private opotions for ministers' consideration - though it would be more reassuring it if embraced alternatives.
