The Home Office should ban the Office for National Statistics from issuing "police-recorded crime figures", such as those published yesterday. The statistics are part of an effort by police forces in England and Walesto resist cuts, boost budgets and bias workloads. Headlines say knife crime was the "highest in six years", "alarming increase in violent crime" and "crime surges". Who says?

Apparently gun crime is "up by 27% in one year, knife crime 26% and robberies 25%". Stalking and harassment are up by an amazing 36% and violence in South Yorkshire up by 49%. Apart from being unbelievable, these numbers do not record crimes at all, but reporting activity in police stations. They are governed by political policies, media-driven priorities and staff accessibilty and numbers.

The only reliable crime indicator is the separate ONS crime survey for England and Wales, measuring the public's experience of crime in the community. This has nothing to do with the police and shows crime continuing to fall, currently at an impressive 9% annually, with falls or "unchanged" in almost all categories. The finding are always published at the same time as the police figures but with no headlines. The police and their ONS allies know that well.
