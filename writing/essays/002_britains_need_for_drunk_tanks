Friday night in a big city casualty department is not a pleasant place to be. Reportedly 70% of patients have nothing wrong with them, other than being blind drunk. What on earth are they doing there?

It seems that nowadays every social nusiance ends up in either a police station or A&E. So much so, that in recent years twelve British cities have been "experimenting" with alcohol recovery units, sobering-up police rooms, lorries or "booze buses". This initiative has been regarded as a success and the government now proposes to roll out the scheme to other towns and cities across the country.

The only mystery is why it has taken so long. The fact that free on demand A&E has been offered as an after-sales service to the urban alcohol industry is ridiculous. Apart from draining resources from already cash strapped service, it is inefficient and unfair to other patients and staff.

It is equally absurd that this cost has fallen on the NHS rather than on the drunks themselves and those who make money serving them.
