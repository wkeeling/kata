Friday night in a hospital casulty department is not a pleasant place to be. Reportedly 70% of the patients have no medical condition, other than being blind drunk. But what are they doing there?

The answer is that nowadays every social nuisance ends up in either a police station or in A&E. Recent years have seen 12 British cities "experimenting" alcohol recovery units, sobering-up police rooms and lorries or "booze buses". These have largely been regarded as successful and now government is looking to roll the scheme out to towns and cities across the country.

But why has it taken so long? To offer up free on-demand A&E as an after-sales service to the urban alcohol industry is ridiculous. Aaprt from being very expensive, it is inefficient and unfair to other patients and staff.
