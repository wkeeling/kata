Friday night in the casulty department of a hospital is not a pleasant place to be. Reportedly, 70% of patients there are not ill but blind drunk. What on earth are they doing there?

The answer is that nowadays every social nuicance seems to end up either in a police station or in A&E. In recent years 12 British cities have been "experimenting" with alocohol recovory units - sobering-up police rooms and lorries or "booze buses". These are regarded as successful and the government is now looking to roll it out to towns and cities across the country.

But why has it taken so long? Offering free on-demand A&E as an after-sales service to the urban alochol industry is ridiculous. Apart from being extremely expensive, it is inefficient and unfair to other patients and staff.

It is madness that this cost has fallen on the NHS rather than on the drunks themselves and those who make money serving them. It would be entirely reasonable to levy a Â£50 charge, certainly less than they would have paid to get drunk  in the first place.
