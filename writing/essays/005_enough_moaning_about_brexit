It was the best of decisions. It was the worst of decisions. It is the season of light. It is the season of darkness - the hope of spring, the winter of despair. Dicken's got it right. Brexit is Britain's French revolution and nobody but nobody has a clue about how it will turn out.

London's most recent inward investor, the New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, has no such doubts. Yesterday he spoke for all liberals when he declared that Brexit was "the stupidest thing any country has ever done" at least "until America Trumped it". He did not mention the millions of people of voted for either, but then liberals are rather down on democracy these days as it hasn't been giving them the answers they want.

What is crashingly obvious is that in eighteen months, Britain is leaving the EU. It is leaving no matter the insults remainers hurl at leavers. It is leaving despite the howls of protest from titans of industry and snowflakes of academia. It could turn out to be very bad, or not as bad as many fear. But it is happening none the less.
