It was the best of decisions, it was the worst of decisions. It was the season of light, it was the season of darkness - the hope of spring, the winter of despair. Brexit is Britain's French Revolution . No one, absolutely no one, has a clue about how it will turn out.

London's new inward investor, former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, had no such doubt. Yesterday he spoke for liberals when he said Brexit was "the stupidest thing any country has ever done", at least "until America Trumped it". Of course he didn't mention the millions of people who voted for one or the other. But it seems that liberals are rather down on democracy these days. It hasn't been giving them the answers they want.

What is crashingly obvious, is that in a year and a half Britain will be leaving the European Union. It is going to leave regardless of abuse hurled at remainers by leavers. It is going to leave however much the chiefs of industry and snowflakes of academia wail and gnash their teeth. It could be the worst of decisions, or it might not be as bad as many fear. But it is happening none the less.

Whilst leavers live in a fantasy land over transitions, quotas and third party deals, remainers seem happy with virtue-signalling so long as one day they can "told you so". But at least leavers have a strategy, which is to let the clock  run until the country falls off the cliff edge. Remainers have no strategy, other than to cry woe.
