On your way to a meeting? Don't go. Turn back. You'll be stuck in an overheated room, shackled to a desk for an absurd amount of time and prevented from doing proper work. Worse still, we are told that just sitting there is a killer. It shortens life. You will die.

According to Public Health England, we are so addicted to meetings that we don't realise the risk they pose to ourselves and our organisations. Its chief executive, Duncan Selbie, apparently told this week's annual meeting that sitting in meetings "haemorrages productivity". It slows metabolism, reduces the body's ability to regulate its sugar and thus blood pressure. This leads to obesity, diabetes, cancer ... and death. Do don't do it. Don't go.

The Get Britain Standing campaign agrees. It says sedentary office activity is now as dangerous to health as smoking. It takes hour of exercise to eliminate the toxins built up in one meeting. Meanwhile, Columbia University Medical Center this week produced a no less alarming statistic. After tracking 8000 individuals across all walks of life it concluded that inactivity for 13 hours or more per day (including sleep) makes "risk of death"2.6 times more likely than it is for inactivity of less than 11 hours.
