The ice mountain is crumbling. The glaciers are loosening. The greatest cultural confidence trick since the medieval monastry is dissolving. This week the universities minister, Jo Johnson, said the unsayable: that the three year British university course, virtually unchanged in 100 years, is absurd and should end.

To Johnson, the vast majority of courses could be completed within two years. The internet has transformed, or should have transformed, teaching methods and research. The dizzying cost of a course, which now averages Â£60,000, is no more defensible then the outrageous vice chancellors saleries, inflexibility in teaching time and curbs on free speech.

Universities have historically resisted attempts at reform by pampering children of the estabilishment in a sort of upmarket finishing school with a vaguely virtuous aura. A hospital makes people well. An army keeps people safe. A court dispenses justice. Some university courses give students a usable skill - in medicine, engineering, chemistry or the law. But most despise such specifics and declare  education is  worthy in itself.
