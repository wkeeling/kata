The ice mountain is cracking. The glaciers are dissolving. The greatest cultural confidence trick since medieval monastry is rupturing. This week the universities minister, Jo Johnson, said the unsayable: the 3 year British univerity course, virtually unchanged for 100 years, is absurd and should end.

To Johnson, the majority of courses could be completed in 2 years. It makes sense now that the internet has transformed teaching methods and student research. The dizzying cost of a course, averaging some Â£60,000, is no more defensible than the outrageous vice chancellors salaries, teaching time inflexibility and curbs on free speech.

Universities have long resisted attempts at reform, cosetting children of the establishment in an upmarket finishing school with vaugely virtuous aura. A hospital makes people well. An army keeps people safe. A court dispenses justice. Some university courses equip people with a usable skill - in  medicine, engineering, the law. But most, especially those in humanities departments, dispise such specifics. With a wave of the hand they declare education "a good" in itself.

Many years ago I attended a debate at London's Institute of Education with two top educational economists, John Vaizey and Mark Blaug. The topic, whether university could be considered a national investment or a vehicle for personal consumption.

Vaizey argued for investment, but provided no rate of return other than platitudes and the fact that graduates earn more money. Blaug's response was that university encourages middle class consumption, merely granting access to better jobs, a strictly personal "rate of return".

At the same event, I recall an East Asian economist pointing out that an explosion in German economic growth preceded, not followed, mass higher education.
