The ice mountain is cracking. The glaciers are loosening. The greatest cultural confidence trick since medieval monastry is dissolving. This week the universities minister, Jo Johnson, said the unsayable: that the three year British university course, virtually unchanged in 100 years, is absurd and should end.

To Johnson, the overwhelming majority of courses can be done in two years. The internet has transformed teaching methods and student research. The dizzying cost of a course, which averages some Â£60,000, is no more defensible than the outrageous vice chancellors salaries, the inflexibility of teaching time and the curbs on free speech.

Until now Universities have vigorously resisted attempts at reform, cossetting children of the establishment in a vaguely upmarket finishing school, virtuous aura. A hospital makes people well. An army keeps people safe. A court dispenses justice. Some univerity courses do equip people with a specific skill - in medicine, engineering, the law. But most, especially huamnities departments, despise such specifics. With a wave of the hand they declare that education is a good in itself.

Many years ago I attended a debate at London's Institute of Education between two top educational economists, John Vaizey and Mark Blaug. The topic was whether a university was a national investment or a vehicle for personal consumption.

Vaizey argued the case for investment but supplied no plausible rate of return, just empty platitudes and the fact that graduates earn more money. Blaug contended that univerities encourage middle class consumption and are a simply a bridge to better jobs.
