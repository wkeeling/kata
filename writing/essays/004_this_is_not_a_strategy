This week the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, announced plans to reopen 5, possibly 8, railway lines originally closed by Richard Beeching in the 1960s. The apparent aim is to help reduce over-crowding and increase capacity. Beeching, who died 25 years ago, was responsible for creating a report that closed 5000 miles of track across the country. The lines he closed are reopening all the time , possibly as many as 50 since the 1980s. Nostalgia is a bad way to plan a railyway.

Richard Beeching must be one of the most abused men in transport history. In 1963 with rail use dropping and road use soaring, he was told by the then Prime Minister Harold Macmillan to "run the railway as a profitable business". He was already involved in a massive switch of British Rail from steam to diesel. But he protested - pointing out that half of his stations generated just 2% of revenue, and a third of the whole network carried just 1% of its passengers. Profit would have to start with closing that third. Macmillan told him to go ahead.

Some of the lines could not muster a dozen passengers a day. It was the rise of the motor car, not Beeching, that butchered the railway. More services were closed between the 1920s and 1950s than by him. Still, Beeching took the brunt of the public's anger and was hugely unpopular. Harold Wilson sacked him when he took office, but continued to quietly implement the cuts.
