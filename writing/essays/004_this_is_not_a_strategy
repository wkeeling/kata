This week the transport secretary, Chris Graying, announced plans to reopen five, possibly eight, railway lines closed by Richard Beeching, supposedly to reduce over crowding and increase capacity. Beeching, whose 1960s' report led to the closure of over 5000 miles of railway has been dead a quarter of a century. The lines he closed are reopening all the time, possibly as many as 50 since the 1980s. Nostalgia is a poor strategy for railway planning.

Richard Beeching was the most abused man in transport history. In 1963, with rail use plummeting and road use soaring, the then prime minister Harold Macmillan told him to "run the railway as a profitable business". He was already involved in engineering a massive switch of British rail from steam to diesel. Beeching protested that he could hardly make a profit when half of his stations generated just 2% of revenue, and that a third of the network carried just 1% of passengers. Profit would have to start with closing that third. Macmillan said go ahead.

Some lines could muster less than  12 passengers per day. It was the rise of the motor car, not Richard Beeching, that butchered the railway. Yet Beeching was hit by a wave of fury, as though he was disolving the British empire, mostly by people who didn't use trains. He was so unpopular that Labour's Harold Wilson sacked him instantly when he took office a year later, before quietly implementing his cuts.
