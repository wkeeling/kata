What do Oxfam, Carillion and the East Coast main line have in common? The answer is that we own them, or run them or at least pay for them to be run. They are agents of government, subcontractors, proxy servants of the state. The government has responsibility for what they spend and picks up the pieces when they fail. These state backed organisations exist in a grey, murky, unaccountable no-mans land somewhere between government and private sector. No-one knows what to do with them.

By the end of the 1970s the Government owned vast swathes of the British economy. It ran railways, ports, coalmines, steelworks and telecommunications. It built ships, airplanes, cars, weapons and computers. It drove most of them into the ground. The public utilities were inefficient, largely because ministers thought they owned them and could not leave them alone. The return on capital was half that of private industry. Strikes were rife. During the inflation crisis of 1974 to 1976 coal and rail fares ran at double the price index. The answer to this was privatisation. It began with Jaguar, Britoil and British Aerospace followed by gas, electricity and water. It moved into local government, prisons, court services and care homes.
