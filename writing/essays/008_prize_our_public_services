What do Oxfam, Carillion and the East Coast main line have in common? They are owned, run or paid for by the government. These organisations are agents of government, subcontractors, proxy servants of the state. The government is responsible for what they spend and picks up the pieces when they fall to bits. They exist in a grey, murky, unaccountable no-mans land somewhere between government and private sector. Nobody knows what to do with them. 

By the end of the 1970s the British state owned half the economy. It ran railways, ports, coal mines, steel works and telecommunications. It built ships, airplanes, cars, weapons and computers. It drove most into the ground. Public utilities were inefficient, largely because ministers thought they owned them and kept meddling. Return on captial was half that of private industry. Strikes were rife. During the inflation crisis of 1974 to 1976 coal and rail fares ran double the price index. The answer to all of this was privatisation. It began with Jaguar, Britoil and British Aerospace, and followed with gas, electricity and water. It moved into local government, prisons, court services and care homes. For the most part it worked. Air fares dropped and train use rose. There was a boom in care home availability.
