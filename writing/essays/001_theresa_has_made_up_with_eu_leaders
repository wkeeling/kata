Last night Theresa May was awarded the apparently rare accolade of applause at an EU leaders' banquet. Excellent. But what were they applauding? Was it relief at her emolient tone? Was it enouragement for the next round of the Brexit wars, or it was just in sympathy from colleagues at her domestic plight? It was significant that the clapping was led by Angela Merkel, whose plight is as dire as May's.

What the prime minister appears to have achieved, is to make Europe's leaders realise that Brexit is going to happen, and that it is in everyone's interests for it to be "orderly". After a tortuous year of negotiations and punishment beatings by Michael Barnier, she has persuaded them that the path of sweet reason might be a better way forward.

Good news indeed. But now a transition deal must be negotiated before any meaningful talks can begin on trade. This deal must cover commerical relations with the EU after 2019 before talks on a permanent deal can begin. Here's the rub. Such a transition deal can only be asymmetrical. Britain must continue to obey EU regulations, treaties and court jurisdictions, but without any of the say. Unless the country is to fall off the cliff and leave without a deal, it means de facto customs union for the duration.

At this point, a steam train hurtles around the bend straight for a divided parlimentary conservative party. Customs union, even as a transitional measure, comes packed with all the backsliding baggage so loathed by Brexit fundamentalists. It might tie Britain's hands in 3rd party trade talks. It might provide a shortcut back back to the single market, or to a Norway or Swiss deal.
