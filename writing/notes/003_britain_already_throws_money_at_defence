Britain already throws money at defence. Ignore this Russian red herring

- Russians, terrorists, atmosphere of fear used as cover for more money
- Each year around the time of the budget the defence lobby makes its case for more.
- The army thinks it will lose many soldiers. The navy and Royal Air Force are worried about the merger of the paratroop and marine brigade and loss of more frigates

- How big is Britain's defence budget in proportion to its population, in the context of the world, EU and Nato
- This is related more to history than to anything else
- What does the nation need? How much can the nation do with? 

- Army, blame.
- Labour in 97 and the coalition 2010 had the chance to re-evaluate the aircraft and trident strategy
- Cost money, serve no purpose - espcially in the age of unmanned drones
- Navy and RAF lobbied, army said nothing
- Ultimately Downing St bowed, but at the expense of the army

- Britain's second aircraft carrier launched last year, total cost close to Â£7b
- Trident extended
- Trident lunacy - removed from defence budget
- Vanity project

- Britains three services should have been merged. Why?
- Defence should be viewed from the perspective of the threat, not history
- British taxes financing interventionism

- The defence spending row - arbitrary target, threat, consume 2% of nation's wealth
- Labour's spokesman, Nia Griffiths, "Britain's international credibility"
- What is she talking about?
- Germany, credibility, no nukes, drone squadrons

- Defence debate decay indicated by language
- Defence now a mish-mash
