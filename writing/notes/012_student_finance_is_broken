- History: Britain's student loan scheme, public-sector project, bad
- Caused £100bn debt for grads, currently predicted to go up to £330bn by 2044, 75% not repaid
- The remainder picked up by the tax payer
- Has to stop
- Existing loans system, transformed by Blair's tuition fee introduction in '98, privatised, pushed up massively by Cameron in 2012, unfair, excessive, costly
- The bad side of privatisation
- Grads become money makers for loan collectors, universities turned into salesperson of cheap courses for high fees, guaranteed by the Treasury

- All very clear so far
- Today's speech, Theresa May, criticise "pricing", of every course at £9000 per year, is valid
- Wants diversified courses, better integrated with vocational training, diversified fees
- Seems honest/practical as far as it goes
- Labour wants everything as today, but  no fees/grants for anyone
- This very expensive, treasury reduce numbers, restricting access
- Both roads lead to further government control of higher education
- Would lead to, central planning of courses, continuing disagreements over prices
- Universities become schools, government agencies
