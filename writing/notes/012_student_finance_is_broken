Student finance is broken. A graduate tax is the only solution

- History: Britain's student loan scheme, public-sector project, bad
- Caused £100bn debt for grads, currently predicted to go up to £330bn by 2044, 75% not repaid
- The remainder picked up by the tax payer
- Has to stop
- Existing loans system, transformed by Blair's tuition fee introduction in '98, privatised, pushed up massively by Cameron in 2012, unfair, excessive, costly
- The bad side of privatisation
- Grads become money makers for loan collectors, universities turned into salesperson of cheap courses for high fees, guaranteed by the Treasury

- All very clear so far
- Today's speech, Theresa May, criticise "pricing", of every course at £9000 per year, is valid
- Wants diversified courses, better integrated with vocational training, diversified fees
- Seems honest/practical as far as it goes
- Labour wants everything as today, but  no fees/grants for anyone
- This very expensive, treasury hugely reduce numbers, restricting access
- Both roads lead to further [endless] government control of higher education
- Would lead to, central planning of courses, continuing disagreements over prices
- Universities become schools, central government agencies

- Favouring students and courses, no practical way Whitehall can do this
- Chaotic, denies academic autonomy, like current attempts at measuring teaching quality and quantifying research 
- And then attempting to link course "value" to future earnings, crazy, disgusting

- Justine Greening, former education secretary, eventually added name, group requesting, one fair way to finance higher education, e.g. before 1990s
- Abolish fees, universities receive direct grants, financed by graduate tax code
- Economists more and more distrust, universities, value to national economy
- Not privileged, spend 3 years at university, end up paying for pay for privileged
- Using tax system, collect graduate earnings, no interest spent on loan sharks
- Correct, rich would end up paying more, over lifetime, university numbers capped
-  Fairer, university not compulsory
- Education secretaries, always leave office before proposing decent solution

- All said, non-graduates should not fund graduates, rich graduates not have easier ride than less well off graduates, happens under loans
- British income tax, not too demanding/oppressive, graduate surtax would not be deterrent to higher education
- Fair and simple
