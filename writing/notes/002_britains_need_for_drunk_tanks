Britain's need for "drunk tanks" shows how broken our society is

- A hospital casulty department on a Friday night is not a nice place to be
- Reportedly 70% of patients are not ill but drunk
- Why are they there?

- Because nowadays every social nuicance seems to end up in a police station or A&E
- In recent years 12 British cities have been trialling alocohol recovery units, sobering-up police rooms, lorries or "booze buses"
- They have been regarded as successful and the government is looking to roll out to towns and cities across the country

- But why has it taken so long?
- It is ridiculous to think that free on demand A&E has been offered as an after-sales service to the urban alcohol industry
- Apart from expensive, it is inefficient and unfair to other patients and staff

- It is crazy that this cost has fallen on the NHS, rather than the drunks themselves and those who make money serving them
- It would be reasonable to levy a Â£50 charge - certainly less than the would have paid to get drunk in the first place
- For those serious cases who do need medical attention, that should come at their own risk, not the states

- This type of thinking and the remedy is needed across the welfare state
- Police stations complain that many of their cells are taken up not by real crime, but by incidents related to mental health, homelessness, drunk and drugs
- Victims have nowhere else to go, other than police cars, stations and cells.
- Likewise many GPs admit that many of their "patients" are not suffering from any real medical condition, but from lonliness
- These people just want an appointment with somebody who they can talk to, and who will listen

- There needs to be some alternative thinking about these social challenges
- The closure of so many police stations, libraries, clinics and day centres for the elderly has taken so much of the help for the lonely and inadequate
- They now only have 999 in order to talk to somebody

- It is not the state but communities that must find a way to take on these responsibilities
- Churches, chapels, primary schools, train stations and town halls often all have unused space
- Space which is wasted
- Villages, towns and cities also have plenty of potential helpers if they can somehow be found and recruited
- It should not be a giant leap to move from drunk tanks to care clubs
