Obesity is a greater threat for millennials than cannabis. Itâ€™s absurd

- Seven out of ten millennials, expected to be "overweight or obese" by late thirties, 50% baby boomers
- NHS burden, type 2 diabetes, expected, huge, damaging
- Iceland and Malta have larger problem in western Europe
- Legitimate government concern thus
- Government evading issue
- Food and drink industries, too much sway

- Obesity less caused by unhealthy "lifestyle", lack of exercise
- Caused by unhealthy eating, drinking, as lung cancer, respiratory illness, smoking
- That large problem dealt with
- Steady declines in lung diseases over 40 years, less smoking, more robust regulation
- US, men stopped smoking faster than women, fewer died

- The debate is over
- Obesity handled, national pandemic
- Sugar industry, push back, responsibility with schools, parents
- True, ridiculous tha advertising shown, happy families eating, big helpings, "bad" food, like when tobacco advertised to have sex appeal
- Advertising products to children, during popular programmes, that we know will do great harm, irresponsible
- Fast food outlets allowed near schools, insane

- But, price big challenge
- Familiar remedies
- High sugar drinks, hyper-processed manufactured goods, harsh tax, like cigarettes
- Alcohol, should be more taxed than current
- School food monitored, fat, flour, sugar levels
- Packages labelled correspondingly
- Government must give the push
- Does not infringe individual liberty
- Only restraint, business abuse, other people's bodies
- Obesity greater threat than marijuana, one is promoted, one criminalised

- Problem political
- Cameron government in 2016 proposed sugar tax, outcry food and drink industry, government caved
- Obesity proposed as compulsory school subject, teachers protested, preaching to kids/parents about appearance
- This reluctance/indecision/sceptiscm will eventually end
- Must be soon
- Within 10 years, 70% millennials could be overweight/obese
- That is ludicrous
