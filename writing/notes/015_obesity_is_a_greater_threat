- Seven out of ten millennials, expected to be "overweight or obese" by late thirties, 50% baby boomers
- NHS burden, type 2 diabetes, expected, huge, damaging
- Iceland and Malta have larger problem in western Europe
- Legitimate government concern thus
- Government evading issue
- Food and drink industries, too much sway

- Obesity less caused by unhealthy "lifestyle", lack of exercise
- Caused by unhealthy eating, drinking, as lung cancer, respiratory illness, smoking
- That large problem dealt with
