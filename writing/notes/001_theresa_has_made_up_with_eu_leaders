Theresa has made up with the EU leaders

- Theresa May was appluaded at last night's EU dinner
- Why? Her tone? To encourage? For sympathy?
- Clapping was led by Angela Merkel who has her own problems

- The prime minister has made leaders realise that Brexit is going to happen and it being orderly.
- After a year of difficult negotiations, she has persuaded them that the path of reason is the way forward

- This is good news
- Now a transition deal must be negotiated, before any real talks on trade can begin
- The deal must cover commerical relations with the EU after 2019 before talks on a permanent deal can begin
~ master/slave relationship...
- Here's the difficulty: a transition deal is likely to be one way. Britain must continue to adhere to EU regulations, treaties and jurisdictions, but without any say
- Unless the UK is to leave without a deal, it means remaining in the customs union for the duration

- This puts the conservative party on a collision course
- The customs union option is disliked by so many conservative brexiters
- It may hold back the UK in 3rd party talks. It might mean a way back to the singlel market, the norway or swiss options

- However recent polling suggests that a majority of the public, business and political communities would be happy with this.
- This therefore should be no problem for Theresa May as she is honouring the referendum result. The implementation can be left up to parliment

- She should therefore take some confort from this week's Commons default. It was stregthening the case for soft brexit.
- Britain needs a customs union, and a version of the single market.
- This will mean concessions on treaties, regulation and court juridiction

- May's parlimentary enemies (soft Brexiters) should not be her problem this week.
- Her fundamentalists pose far more of a problem and soon she must deal with them.
- She must leave the EU sensibly.
- In order to do so she must make friends, both her diners in Brussels and her soft brexit rebels who deserted her this week. She will need them.
