- Less than 12 passengers per day on some lines
- More effect of motor car, rather than Beeching, on railway. More services closed between 1920s - 1950s 
- Beeching took brunt of anger from public, demise of empire, people who didn't use trains
- Beeching very unpopular. Harold Wilson sacked him when took office. Still implemented cuts
