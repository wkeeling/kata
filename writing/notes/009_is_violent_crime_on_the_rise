Is violent crime on the rise â€“ or do the latest figures mask a different story?

- Home Office, stop, Office for National Statistics, issuing, "police-recorded crime figures"
- Statistics, police force campaign, England & Wales, against cuts, extra budget, bending the truth on workloads
- Headlines, knife crime, "highest for six years", "alarming increase in violent crime", "crime surges"
- Really?

- Apparently gun crime "up by 27%" in one year, knife crime 26%, robberies 25%
- Staking/harassment, up by amazing 36%
- South Yorkshire violence up by 49%
- Unbelievable, do not record crime figures, more reporting activity in police stations
- Governed by political policies, media priorities, staff accessibility & numbers
