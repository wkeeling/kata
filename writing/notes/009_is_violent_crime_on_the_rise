Is violent crime on the rise â€“ or do the latest figures mask a different story?

https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/20/violent-crime-rise-police-figures-different-story-office-national-statistics

- Home Office, stop, Office for National Statistics, issuing, "police-recorded crime figures", published yesterday
- Statistics, police force campaign, England & Wales, to, against cuts, extra budget, bending the truth on workloads
- Headlines, knife crime, "highest for six years", "alarming increase in violent crime", "crime surges"
- Really?

- Apparently gun crime "up by 27%" in one year, knife crime 26%, robberies 25%
- Stalking/harassment, up by amazing 36%
- South Yorkshire violence up by 49%
- Unbelievable, do not record crimes, more reporting activity in police stations
- Governed by political policies, media-driven priorities, staff accessibility & numbers

- Reliable crime indicator, separate ONS crime survey for England and Wales, measures public exeperience of crime in community
- Unrelated to police, shows crime continuing to fall, currently impressive 9% annually, falls or "unchanged" in almost all categories
- Conclusion always published same time as police figures, no headlines
- Police, ONS allies know that

- Head of ONS, John Flatley, yesterday cautioned police figures "cannot provide a measure of all crime", and "improvements made by police forces in recording crime are still a factor"
- Improvement == bias
- Crime survey of England and Wales, no infrequently experienced crimes, knife killings, no justification for ONS publishing, likely showing police distortion, abuse

Don't try and paraphrase the notes!

- Britain's police now very centralised, statistics for "shroud waving", inevitable
- Police forces, keep employees, austerity
- Political bias on "historical"/other sx crime, forces spending 1/3 resources
- Also, tring to drop community support officers
- "de-prioritise" burglaries, thefts, accusation, failing in their duty

- Police joke, "cut crime", close police station
- Long decline in recorded figures, appeared to coincide with station closures, forces reducing drug busts
- Current rise, stricter insurance requirements, more openness sx crime, more online reporting
- "Recording", function of police practice, not social misbehaviour

- ONS disrepute, politics, figures
- Should allow police forces publish own figures, only publish crime survey of England and Wales, good and bad parts
- Still have no idea if knife crime going up/down
