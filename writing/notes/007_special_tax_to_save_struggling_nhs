A special tax to save the struggling NHS won’t work. Here’s why 

https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/05/special-nhs-tax-wont-work-why

- Special tax, bad idea
- Idea by special health professionals naive
- Won't happen, distraction
- Every other good cause want its own tax
- Treasury, reduce existing spending

- Panel, 10 senior figures, NHS, GP, nursing, created by Lib Dems

- This winter, flu epidemic, pressure, hospitals
- Led to, critical ops postponed, lack of beds, people moved in/out hospital
- Does not prove lack of money, breakdown in coordination between GPs, hospitals., community care

- Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, resources into the NHS
- Chief beneficiaries, medical salaries, drug company profits, pfi contractors
- Post 2010, coalition austerity, community care cut by 30%, effect on surgeries and hospitals
- NHS received money, but cut from home care, day centres, ancillary services (maternity, elderly depend)
- Special tax in England won't resolve, special council tax community care, postcode lotteries

- Welfare state founded, national insurance
- Ringfenced, but merged into general taxation
- Car taxes on road building
- Lottery not replace normal arts/sport spending
- All proven not to be the case
- Health surtax on incomes, Treasury cut/freeze existing spending

- Lib Dem enquiry, good idea, NHS regime lobby bad idea
- Profession will not suggest reform of itself, esp doctors
- Best idea, bi-partisan royal commission, look at wasted NHS money -- drugs, agencies + PFI, professional barriers between GPs, consultants, nurses, pharmacists, care workers
- Known that NHS demand increasing, Care Quality Commission predicting a "sharp decine" in future service
- Overseas systems, outperform NHS, ration using selective pricing, or insurance

- British NHS rations, through its problems
- Tax payers could pay more for it, but reform needed
