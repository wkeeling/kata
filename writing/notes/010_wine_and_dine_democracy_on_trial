Wine and dine democracy is now on trial â€“ and about time

- Every US gunman shooting rampage, British media fury, money, gun lobby, gives to interests
- Large scale lobbying, constant disorder of American politics
- In US this has real repercussions
- Britons look at own hypocracy, on principle --> leading to...

- Money spent, property companies lobbying Westminster city council's planning committee, may be outspent by those in US
- Hospitality spent on, committee's chairman, Robert Davis, astonishing
- Five hundred gifts, including 10 foreign trips, in three years
- 150 from a well known list of property industry figures
- Harvey Weinstein on the list
- Davis entertaining, obviously, ~Westminster business~ 
- Back to back entertaining, hardly any time between

- London's Evening Standard's Jim Armitage, inside committee, as local resident objecting to planning application, watched planning appovals, ticked off regularly, ~like clockwork~
- He noted, no objections upheld
- Members, "looked at the ceiling, buffed their nails and scratched their noses", each application waved through

- Westminster council noted this week, all hospitality received, during "meetings", and councillors "could be bought by the property lobby was demonstrably untrue"
- Meetings took place, Wimbledon, performance of musical Hamilton, south of France
- OK if gifts/hospitality declared
- Assumes what is declared, cannot be considered a "financial or other advantage", 2010 Bribery Act, offered or accepted to secure "improper performance"
- Transparency insufficient

- Late Irvine Sellar's 72 storey "Paddington Pole", incredible case of Davis's
- Needed demolition of Edwardian baroque sorting office, erection of gigantic tower, within boundary of conservation area, towering over Brunel's Paddington Station
- Proposed in 2016, and breached good planning principles, Sellar entertained Davis, sealed approval, Davis described "potential masterpiece"
- Sellar added seven more storeys to his plans
- Plans for pole withdrawn after public objections, replaced with proposal for lower glass box, bigger in volume
- Davis declared "game changer", planning committee waved through, local opposition

- Next, raises eyebrows
- Council ignores protestors, appeal for meeting
- Sadiq Khan, mayor of London, no intervention, despite unsutability, conservation area, large box
- Planning minister, Sajid Javid, also refuses, no reasons
- Unusal for controversial project
- Shard, public enquiry, developed by Sellar
- Protestors take Javid's refusal to court of appeal, why no intervention
