Enough moaning about Brexit: remainers must say what theyâ€™re for

- Best decision, worst decision.
- Season of light, season of darkness - hope of spring, winter of dispair
- No one knows how it will end

- London investor, Bloomberg (former NY mayor) is sure
- Yesterday he spoke for liberals when he said "the stupidest thing any country has ever done" and "until America Trumped it"
- Did not mention millions who voted 
- Liberals down on democracy
- Wrong answers

- Obvious, Britain is leaving EU in 18 months
- Leaving, no matter about remainers vs leavers
- Leaving, despite industry and academia protest
- Could be v bad, or not as bad as many fear
- But happening none the less

- Leavers in fantasy land over transitions, quotas, third party deals, remainers keep virtue-signalling so one day "told you so"
- Leavers at least have strategy, let clock run until fall off the cliff
- Remainers no strategy, except whinge
- Soft Brexit options - no sign of concerted efforts behind 

- British consitution, no problem, soft Brexit
- Referendum said "leave the EU"
- Did not specify hard/soft, just leave formal treaty framework
- How not on ballot
- Delegated to parliment by default, can choose how to implement
- Decide how to trade with Europe, with not remaining
- Voters don't get a choice on the decision
- Must wait until next election

- Every opinion poll, tally of MPs, industrial lobby, ecomonic pressire group clear
- Majority wants free trade, mostly open borders

- No majority for hard Brexit
- No one wants nurse shortages, care homes closing, lorry queues at Dover or hospitality industry to suffer
- Leave's argument, it's own Project Fear.
