I'm not suprirsed by Cariilion's failure

- Doing business with government a safe bet
- Even so, Carillion failed
- What about all of it's contracts in prisons, schools etc?
- How will it guarantee those contracts?
- The public sector carries on anyway

- How does Carrilion's collapse affect privatisation?
- Private companies have always taken advantage
- Examples

- What does the Carrilion collapse demonstrate?
- Examples of bad behaviour
- Why was it allowed?
- How did government behave?

- How to remedy privatisation?
- The two way dependency between these companies and the state
- The relationship of their lobbysists

- Finding a solution, how it has evaded government
- What rules should there be?
- Ultimately Carrilion's contracts and workers will be saved
- But what of the officials and ministers?
- Who agreed the original contracts and why?

- What good should come out of this?
