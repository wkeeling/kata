Britain can control immigration. What drives this debate is nasty politics 

https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/06/britain-control-immigration-debate-nasty-politics-social-neglect-brexit

- Looks are more important in politics than metrics
- Home Office draft on post-EU migration policy, leaked on Tuesday, shows harshest side of Brexit
- Language, restrictive of Home Office
- --> prison metaphor to describe the migrants, border
- Home Office poor track record: border computer mess, detention violence embarassment, bizarre "go home" letters to foreigners, Home Office, special measures
- Makes a mockery/humourous of Theresa May's smooth approach to Brexit, however the message is twisted

- Document ignorant economically
- Possibly because Amber Rudd's migration advisory committee, producing report on Brexit's costs, not published until next year
- Planned bureaucracy, drilling into records of all employers, landlords, is enormous
- Reminiscent of disarray, state income control, 1970s
- Planned policy, Inspectors, in buildings

- Boundless, labour costs, policy demands, on industries, leisure and tourism (on of Britain's largest), health and welfare state, construction industry
- Syndicalism, old fashioned, restriction, foreign access, labour market
- Deride, leaver's claim, block borders, elevates Britain's role, expanding global economy

~ positives...
- Being charitable, departments can provide private options for ministers' consideration, more reassuring if embraced alternatives
- Safeguards for current EU nationals working in Britain, not changed by plans
- Continuation of visa-free access, for transition period, followed by possible residency, proposals suggest
- Similar to worker regulations, other EU countries

- Plans reflect existing controls on non-EU residents, but very [bleakly] ineffective
- Non-EU migrants outnumber EU migrants by 18,000 per year
- More likely to be served by Canadian, Columbian, Eritrean in London cafe, than by Pole or a Portuguese
- "Taking back control" in proposed way, probably won't make much difference
- PM likely knows this
- Did not curb non-EU migration when in Home Office, [very obvious]

- Britain's Border controls, more a suggestion, than control, very permeable
- Migrant flow, more to do with economic growth, exchange rates, rather than public policy
- --> Net migration slowed greatly/suddenly after 2008 collapse, again after Brexit vote, slump in pound
- One of Britain's largest developments, London's Battersea power station, complaining of losing workers, one housebuilder reported, lost 4000 EU workers, 20% workforce over Christmas
- Do the Brexiters reall want this?
- Gangmasters, labour agents, would exploit, game system
