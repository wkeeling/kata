- It's OK then
- A pint a day keeps the doc...
- A pint of beer
- Used to be milk, yes, before milk bad
- Egg the same
- Alcohol now good again
- Seven pints of beer, or bottle and a half of wine, dramtically cut diabetes risk
- It's official, Danish scientists, why argue

- The daily stories coming from medical research, normally followed by appeal for cash, what should readers make of it
- Turn previous upside down, get biggest headline
- Vitamins good for you, or useless
- Exercise good for your heart, might kill, depending on who
- Complex carbs good, otherwise bad
- Cholestoral has good, and bad, varieties
- Microbiome theory, all sorts of frights, pleasures

- Some things are getting better
- Sellers of cigarettes, fats, cereals, stout used pseudo-science to highight health benefits
- Perhaps killed hundreds of thousands
- Advertising, scientific review, controlled badness

- New problem, self diagnosis
- Doctors say majority of patients investigate problems online, just want a prescription
- Blossoming health columns in media, same effect
